# Installation of all necessary packages for ReactJS.

write the following command

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

With this command what we do is install ReactJS on our computer globally. If we did not add the -g parameter we could only use ReactJS in the folder where we have executed the code. We can also check if it has been executed correctly with the command

```
create-react-app --version
```

# How to create a ReactJS project on Windows?

It is very simple and we are going to do it from the same command console. We will go to the directory where we want the new project to be stored and write the following command

```
create-react-app my-app
```
This command will generate everything you need to start using the new ReactJS application.


# Install bootstrap
```
npm i bootstrap
```


# Install prop-types

Runtime type checking for React props and similar objects.

You can use prop-types to document the intended types of properties passed to components. React (and potentially other libraries—see the checkPropTypes() reference below) will check props passed to your components against those definitions, and warn in development if they don’t match.

```
npm i prop-types
```




# Install Animate.css

Animate.css supports the prefers-reduced-motion media query so that users with motion sensitivity can opt out of animations. On supported platforms (currently all the majors browsers and OS), users can select "reduce motion" on their operating system preferences and it will turn off CSS transitions for them without any further work required.

```
npm i animate.css
```



# Install gh pages npm
Publish files to a gh-pages branch on GitHub (or any other branch anywhere else).

```
npm i gh-pages
```


# npm run deploy

It runs npm run build and then starts getting the gh-pages -d build command to tell it that the build folder is the one to deploy and with this once finished it will send me a POSTED message.


```
npm run deploy
```

To make changes to the REACT application, first load the changes with GIT and then run the <strong>npm run deploy</strong> command to see the changes.
