# Installation of all necessary packages for ReactJS.

write the following command

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

With this command what we do is install ReactJS on our computer globally. If we did not add the -g parameter we could only use ReactJS in the folder where we have executed the code. We can also check if it has been executed correctly with the command

```
create-react-app --version
```

# How to create a ReactJS project on Windows?

It is very simple and we are going to do it from the same command console. We will go to the directory where we want the new project to be stored and write the following command

```
create-react-app my-app
```
This command will generate everything you need to start using the new ReactJS application.
